## Cheese Wheel

Get cheesy **[here](https://cheese-wheel.herokuapp.com/#/)**.

Cheese wheel is a **MEAN stack** web application that uses a [d3.js](d3js.org) zoomable sunburst partition layout to visualize a small subset of cheese objects and their attributes (milk source, type, country, and name). The sunburst hierarchy is structured as follows:
  - **Level 0**: Root; All cheeses (center)
  - **Level 1**: Each arc represents a cheese milk source
  - **Level 2**: Each arc represents a cheese type (e.g. soft, hard, etc.) per given milk source
  - **Level 3**: Each arc represents a country of origin per given cheese type and milk source
  - **Level 4**: Each arc represents a single cheese item per given country of origin, type, and milk source
